title: Advanced Tab Navigation
---
For years, users have called for a better tab navigation experience in Obsidian. Preferences vary — some users like opening notes in new tabs, others prefer IDE-style workflows, while some aim to avoid duplicate tabs entirely. Managing multiple tab groups has often led to confusion, and while a few plugins provide partial solutions, they tend to fall short — working only in specific scenarios or with certain plugins.

Vertical Tabs presents a universal, seamless, and consistent solution designed to work across the entire Obsidian ecosystem. Vertical Tabs offers five powerful preset strategies to match different workflows. You can also create custom strategies tailored to your preferences.

1. **Obsidian+**: Supercharge Obsidian’s default behavior with a smarter, more intuitive tab control algorithm. Perfect for those who prefer a browser-like experience with familiar functionality.
2. **IDE Mode**: Inspired by tools like Xcode, VSCode, and JetBrains, this mode features automatic tab deduplication, ephemeral tabs, and intelligent navigation, delivering a professional-grade IDE experience.
3. **Explorer Mode**: Designed for deep exploration, this mode keeps your workspace clean by preventing tab clutter, so you can explore your vault without worrying about hundreds of open tabs.
4. **Notebook Mode**: Just like Luhmann’s paper-made Zettelkasten, you won’t accidentally open the same note in multiple tabs and a smart algorithm is here for you to bring the consistent experience.
5. **Prefer New Tab**: If you always want notes to open in new tabs, this strategy provides an elegant, universal solution that works seamlessly with any plugin.
