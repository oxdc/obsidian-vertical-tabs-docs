## Key Benefits

Productive users of Obsidian often find themselves juggling a large number of open notes, and the default horizontal tab layout can make it challenging to locate and switch between them. As more notes are opened, tabs become narrower, making titles harder to read. This can lead to decreased productivity and increased frustration.

Vertical Tabs offers a solution by introducing a vertical list of tabs, allowing users to [[tab groups|group]] and [[navigation|organize]] tabs for more efficient navigation.

As *the* workspace manager for Obsidian, Vertical Tabs provides many handy features like [[per-tab zooming]], [[zen mode]], [[tab history browser]], and an [[enhanced keyboard tab switcher]]. Additionally, it supports [[advanced tab navigation]] with customizable presets, such as [[IDE mode]], which delivers a VSCode-like experience with [[ephemeral tabs]] and automatic [[tab deduplication]]. Users can also create personalized [[custom strategy|tab navigation strategies]] for finer control.

Using Vertical Tabs can bring many benefits to your workflow, including:

* **Increased productivity:** With Vertical Tabs, you can quickly and easily navigate and switch between notes, saving you time and reducing frustration.
* **Improved organization:** Vertical Tabs allows you to [[tab groups|group]] and [[navigation|organize]] your tabs in a way that makes sense to you, making it easier to find the information you need.
* **Enhanced navigation:** With Vertical Tabs, you can use [[advanced tab navigation]] to customize your experience in Obsidian, especially if you want IDE-like navigation behavior.
