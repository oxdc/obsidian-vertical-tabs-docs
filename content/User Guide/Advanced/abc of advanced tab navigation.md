title: The ABC of Advanced Tab Navigation
---
1. **Obsidian+**: Supercharge Obsidian’s default behavior with a smarter, more intuitive tab control algorithm. Perfect for those who prefer a browser-like experience with familiar functionality.
2. **IDE Mode**: Inspired by tools like Xcode, VSCode, and JetBrains, this mode features automatic tab deduplication, ephemeral tabs, and intelligent navigation, delivering a professional-grade IDE experience.
3. **Explorer Mode**: Designed for deep exploration, this mode keeps your workspace clean by preventing tab clutter, so you can explore your vault without worrying about hundreds of open tabs.
4. **Notebook Mode**: Just like Luhmann’s paper-made Zettelkasten, you won’t accidentally open the same note in multiple tabs and a smart algorithm is here for you to bring the consistent experience.
5. **Prefer New Tab**: If you always want notes to open in new tabs, this strategy provides an elegant, universal solution that works seamlessly with any plugin.
